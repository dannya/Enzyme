Enzyme Language Translations
----------------------------
These language subdirectories only store the compiled .MO string files,
which allows the Enzyme interface to be used by end users in different
languages, but means that changes/additions to translation strings are 
not able to be made from here.
 
This is intentional.
Translations for Enzyme are done in the KDE subversion repository, in
/trunk/l10n-kde4/templates/messages/others/
